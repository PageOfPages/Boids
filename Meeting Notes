Week 1:

This Weeks assignment is to learn Latex and prepare a proof for potential. 
LaTeX
  - MacOS --> TeXShop
  - Windows --> MilkTex
Link to online documentation, https://www.overleaf.com/learn/latex/Learn_LaTeX_in_30_minutes
After we're comfortable with LaTeX, we'll create a LaTeX pdf with a proof for the potential formula. 

Next week we'll look closer at shende_code.py and incoperating the inertia formula.

The current code still needs a way to store clusters. 
SQLite - ways to free space:
  - clamshell
  - cs projects
SQLite alternative is python module Shelves (https://docs.python.org/3/library/shelve.html)

Month Goal:
Create a simulation that tracks how potential changes after each step

March Goal:
Present Poster at CURCA. The event will be online. We'll prepare a poster and a recording.
Our poster will compete against other posters in our category. There are about 50 groups
participating. At the online event, live questions will be asked about our research. 
  The Presentation:
    - Demo simulation that tracks how potential changes after each step
    - demonstrate,
      1. how the rate of convergence is so diferent between dumbell system vs HK system
      2. how on average, a random configuration of points (in a linear system) will converge fast. 
We need to apply to participate by February 26th. Link to apply --> https://powerforms.docusign.net/d175acc9-6199-46a8-9d82-8ba5c0e1066e?env=na2&acct=f016204a-5e87-45b4-913d-b9f48679948f&accountId=f016204a-5e87-45b4-913d-b9f48679948f
